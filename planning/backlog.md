# Backlog

## Must-Haves

- As a user I want to see a `main` section with your name so that I can
  understand who is the page about.

- As a user I want to see a `sidebar` with the menu and social links, so that I
  can navigate through the page and follow you on social media.

- As a user I want to see a `portfolio` section with your works, so that I can
  see the projects you have done.

- As a user I want to see a `contact me` section so that I can contact you in
  case I have questions or suggestions.

- As a user I want to see a `footer` section so that I can understand this is
  the end of the page.
